# sea animals final project 
My project will consist of inserting an image into a code and then once the code is processed it should post what the animals name is with a confidence rate

As you can see based on the data I had inserted, it sended a picture of the name of the animal with the confidence rate proving that it worked. 


## The Algorithm
My final project for nvidia is a Sea Animal identification project. This project works by me inserting a photo of a Sea Animal into the code I created, after that I would hit enter and let the code process the image by using the data I used to traun the AI on. Once it is done processing it should send out a link to the image with a name that the AI identified it as and a confidence rate with how sure it is that name. 
EX.

as you can see it sent out the image with what species it thinks it is along with a confidence rate of how sure it is that species.
