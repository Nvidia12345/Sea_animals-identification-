# sea animals final project 
My project will consist of inserting a sea-animal image into my AI model running on Jetson nano and then once the code is processed, the AI model should post what the sea-animal name is with a confidence rate

As you can see based on the data I had inserted, it sent a label on the picture with the name of the animal along with the confidence rate proving that it worked. 

## The Algorithm
My final project for NVIDIA is a Sea Animal identification project. This project works by me inserting a photo of a Sea Animal into the code I created, after that I would hit enter and let the code process the image by using the data I used to traun the AI on. Once it is done processing it should send out a link to the image with a name that the AI identified it as and a confidence rate with how sure it is that name. 
EX.

As you can see it sent out the image with what species it thinks it is along with a confidence rate of how sure it is that species.


## Running this project
Step by step process of what it took to complete my project 

1.connect my jetson nano to VS Code - you first have to click the connect to button, then click your IP adress to fully connect it.

2. once you are done connecting to the VS Code you then have to export all your images that you want to train your jetson nano on

as you can see after doing all these steps you can export those images onto your VS code which you can use to train your AI. 

3. The next step is that you have to use your images to train your model.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20f279c4-538b-4122-907b-765988fed2c2)

when your done running this you should get a loading menu like this.

once that is done loading you can continue to enter your code and train your model

while that runs it should look like this.

4. After your AI is done training you can proceed to test it. You can test it by running this code.

by doing this you are just inserting variables for when you enter your it knows where to pull it from.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f5f572c-1966-40b3-9303-7a74fd649361)
this is the code your have to run to test your image.

5. once your done you should get you final results

as you can clearly see it works and it printed the name of the species and the confidence rate. 
















1. Add steps for running this project.
2. Make sure to include any required libraries that need to be installed for your project to run.
